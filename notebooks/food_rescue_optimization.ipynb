    "## Multi-Objective Optimization: Balancing Cost Reduction and Equity\n",
    "\n",
    "We now combine the two objectives studied earlier:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reduced Cost Objective** — minimize total transportation cost plus a large penalty on unmet demand.  \n",
    "2. **Equity Objective** — minimize the worst unmet demand across neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two goals can conflict:  \n",
    "efficient routing can increase inequity, while equitable distribution can increase transportation cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore the tradeoff, we form a **scalarized multi-objective**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min \\;\n",
    "w_{\\text{cost}} \\cdot \\text{CostObjective}\n",
    "\\;+\\;\n",
    "w_{\\text{eq}} \\cdot \\text{EquityObjective}.\n",

    "M \\sum_{k \\in N} u_k,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $u_k$ represents unmet demand in neighborhood $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equity objective component\n",
    "\n",
    "The equity term is simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{EquityObjective} = t,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $t$ is constrained so that:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "t \\ge d_k - r_k \\quad \\forall k \\in N.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $t$ equals the **worst (maximum) unmet demand** across neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weight Sweep: $1{:}1$ through $1{:}10$ and back from $10{:}1$ to $2{:}1$\n",
    "\n",
    "To fully explore the continuum between efficiency and fairness, we solve the combined model under **19 weight pairs**, starting with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $1{:}1, 1{:}2, \\ldots, 1{:}10$  (equity increasingly emphasized)\n",
    "\n",
    "and then sweeping back:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $10{:}1, 9{:}1, \\ldots, 2{:}1$  (cost increasingly emphasized)\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, the set of weight pairs is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(w_{\\text{cost}}, w_{\\text{eq}}) \\in\n",
    "\\{(1,1), (1,2), \\ldots, (1,10),\n",
    "\\; (10,1), (9,1), \\ldots, (2,1)\\}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For each pair, we record:\n",
    "\n",
    "- total transportation cost  \n",
    "- maximum unmet demand $t$  \n",
    "- total food delivered  \n",
    "- total unmet demand  \n",
    "- which neighborhoods receive food  \n",
    "\n",
    "This sweep traces out the **Pareto frontier** between cost reduction and equitable food distribution, revealing how solutions shift as we change the relative importance of the two objectives.\n"

    "## Interpretation of Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulation 1 describes a **two-stage stochastic minimum-distance model** in which the planner chooses which donation centers to open (via the binary variables $z_j$) before uncertainty in demand is realized, and then determines optimal food flows for each scenario $s \\in S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **objective** minimizes the total expected transportation cost (cost from restaurants to donation centers should probs be equal to cost from donation centers to neighborhoods) plus any unmet-demand penalties, together with fixed opening costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First constraint:** Ensures that each restaurant $i$ can send at most its available surplus $a_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Second constraint:** States that, for each center $j$, the total inflow from restaurants must equal its total outflow to neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Third constraint:** Enforces that each neighborhood $k$ in scenario $s$ receives food $r_k^s$ equal to the flow from all centers plus any unmet demand $u_k^s$ must satisfy total demand $d_k^s$.\n",
    "\n",
