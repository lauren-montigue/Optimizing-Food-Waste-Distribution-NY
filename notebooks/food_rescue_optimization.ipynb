    "## Interpretation of Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulation 1 describes a **two-stage stochastic minimum-distance model** in which the planner chooses which donation centers to open (via the binary variables $z_j$) before uncertainty in demand is realized, and then determines optimal food flows for each scenario $s \\in S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **objective** minimizes the total expected transportation cost (cost from restaurants to donation centers should probs be equal to cost from donation centers to neighborhoods) plus any unmet-demand penalties, together with fixed opening costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First constraint:** Ensures that each restaurant $i$ can send at most its available surplus $a_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Second constraint:** States that, for each center $j$, the total inflow from restaurants must equal its total outflow to neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Third constraint:** Enforces that each neighborhood $k$ in scenario $s$ receives food $r_k^s$ equal to the flow from all centers plus any unmet demand $u_k^s$ must satisfy total demand $d_k^s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fourth constraint:** Links the flows into each center $j$ to its opening decision through the capacity parameter $\\overline{Q}_j$, ensuring no flow can pass through a center that is not opened."
